# Debug with SCF History

Your goal is to debug an issue using buildstate context.

Context available:
- Recent changes: [buildstate.json](../buildstate.json) → decisions[]
- Session log: buildstate.json → session_log[]
- Known issues: buildstate.md → Known Issues section

Steps:
1. Check session_log for recent changes
2. Review decisions[] for architectural context
3. Use buildstate.md for known issues
4. Document solution in buildstate
