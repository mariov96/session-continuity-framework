## 🚨 OPERATING PROCEDURES (ENHANCED)

### YOLO Mode: ENABLED WITH INTELLIGENCE
**Philosophy**: Implement rapidly with ecosystem wisdom, iterate fearlessly with proven patterns, learn continuously from community success.

### BUILDSTATE Priority: CRITICAL + ECOSYSTEM AWARE
**Rules That Must ALWAYS Be Respected**:

1. **ALWAYS Update BUILDSTATE Files Before Compression/Closeout**
   - Both BUILDSTATE.json (technical) and BUILDSTATE.md (strategic) must reflect ecosystem learnings
   - Update session_log with ALL changes AND lessons learned from similar projects
   - Track proposed changes with references to successful patterns in other projects
   - Never compress conversations without capturing ecosystem insights

2. **ALWAYS Maintain Sync Between Files WITH ECOSYSTEM CONTEXT**
   - BUILDSTATE.json = Technical implementation with voice automation best practices
   - BUILDSTATE.md = Strategic vision informed by community project successes
   - Both must reflect HEAD version AND incorporate proven patterns from ecosystem
   - Both must reference resource documents AND similar project learnings

3. **ALWAYS Track Proposed Changes WITH SUCCESS PATTERNS**
   - Log ALL recommendations with references to successful implementations
   - Document priorities based on ecosystem evidence and proven value
   - Track what's blocked and compare with how other projects solved similar issues
   - Update progress and celebrate wins that match community success patterns
