# 🔄 Signal Opportunity Check

## What You Just Received From Hub

This project was just synced with the SCF hub. New knowledge available:

- IDE configurations: vscode
- Project learnings: 6 files

## 🎯 Your Turn: Look for Learnings to Signal Back!

Now that you've received learnings from the ecosystem, take a moment to consider what **this project** might contribute back. The best learnings come from real work - things you've discovered, patterns you've established, or optimizations you've made.

### Areas to Check (especially those similar to what you just learned)

**IDE/Editor Configurations** (high value - you just received IDE configs!)
- [ ] `.vscode/settings.json` - Any project-specific settings worth sharing?
- [ ] `.vscode/tasks.json` - Useful task configurations?
- [ ] `.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configurations that work well?
- [ ] Editor-specific files (`.editorconfig`, prettier configs, etc.)

**Build & Development Patterns**
- [ ] Build optimizations that improved performance
- [ ] Development workflow shortcuts
- [ ] Testing configurations that caught real bugs
- [ ] CI/CD patterns that work well

**Code Patterns & Decisions**
- [ ] Architectural decisions with clear rationale
- [ ] Error handling patterns that proved robust
- [ ] Performance optimizations with measured impact
- [ ] API design patterns worth replicating

**Troubleshooting & Fixes**
- [ ] Bug fixes with non-obvious root causes
- [ ] Environment setup gotchas and solutions
- [ ] Dependency conflicts and resolutions

### Quality Filter (Signal if...)

✅ **DO signal** if the learning:
- Has clear rationale (not just "we did X")
- Would benefit other projects in this ecosystem
- Solves a real problem you encountered
- Has measurable or observable impact
- Is specific enough to be actionable

❌ **DON'T signal** if it's:
- Project-specific with no broader applicability
- Common knowledge in the language/framework
- Incomplete or experimental
- Just boilerplate or scaffolding

### How to Signal

Add to `.scf/spoke-signals.jsonl`:

```json
{"type": "pattern", "topic": "Your discovery", "impact": 8, "rationale": "Why this matters...", "context": "When to apply", "date": "2025-12-24"}
```

Impact scale: 1-10 (7+ = worth propagating to ecosystem)

💡 **Remember**: You don't need to find something every session. Quality over quantity!
The best signals are things you'd want to tell yourself if you were starting a similar project.
